Each keypoint is a tactic to help you refine your UX skillsets, which would also include potential pitfalls and solutions of each tactic to consider.

## Building a relationship with a UX mentor
Mentors are invaluable because they are able to use their experience to fill in any knowledge gaps that a budding ux designer would have at the beginning. Chances are that they have already asked the same questions as you before. This is important because if they have tried any methods, they can tell you what worksor does not work. Even if they have not tried solving the issues, they stand in a better position to provide sound advice by using any transferable lessons learnt in their own expert areas.

There are many avenues to find a UX mentor.
* Mentoring networks
* Conferences
* Local meet-ups

#### Potential pitfalls
* Unresponsive or ineffective mentors
* Unresponsive you

## Becoming a UX apprentice
This tactic may sound similar to the first one, but apprenticeship here connotes a stronger meaning for a formal learning experience. While the previous point talks about getting on-the-job advice from more experienced individuals, this tactic mainly discusses learning bootcamps that focuses on bringing an individual from "UX Zero" to "UX Hero" within the span of a few months.

Bootcamps can be classified into online or in-person, each with its advantages and disadvantages.

## Engaging in individual UX projects
