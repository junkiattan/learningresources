Author: [Tan Jun Kiat](https://github.com/junkiattan)

## Overview
Improving your skills as someone new to UX Design is crucial to getting a UX-related career. In addition to knowing the definition of UX Design and it's stages, it is also important to know the practical aspect of how to get started and how to actually refine the required skillsets. This section will explain a few tactics to help you on this journey of improvement.

#### Summary of keypoints
1. Building a relationship with a UX mentor
1. Becoming a UX apprentice
1. Engaging in individual UX projects

Each keypoint is a tactic to help you refine your UX skillsets, which would also include potential pitfalls and solutions to consider.

## Building a relationship with a UX mentor
Mentors are invaluable because they are able to use their experience to fill in any knowledge gaps a budding ux designer would have at the beginning. Chances are that they have already asked the same questions as you before. This is important because if they have tried any methods, they can tell you what works or does not work. Even if they have not tried solving the issues, they stand in a better position to provide sound advice by using any transferable lessons learnt in their own expert areas.

There are many avenues to find a UX mentor.
* Mentoring networks
* Conferences
* Local meet-ups

#### Potential pitfalls
Unresponsive or ineffective mentors: Not everyone would be cut out to be a mentor, hence it is up to you to determine if your needs are being met by a specific mentor. The key thing is to always be proactive on your side by following up with your mentor, and having the courage to move on if you feel that the specific mentorship isn't working out.

## Becoming a UX apprentice
This tactic may sound similar to the first one, but apprenticeship here connotes a stronger meaning for a formal learning experience. While the previous point talks about getting on-the-job advice from more experienced individuals, this tactic mainly discusses learning bootcamps that focuses on bringing an individual from "UX Zero" to "UX Hero" within the span of a few months.

Bootcamps can be classified into online or in-person, each with its advantages and disadvantages.

#### Online
Broadly speaking, the main advantages of online courses are it's convenience and price. Generally, online courses cater to students from any country and are more affordable than in-person courses. Most online courses are also self-paced based on each student's schedule. However, online courses lack the in-person interactions which can impact the learning experience. Completing online courses also requires long term self-discipline, which places more responsibility on the student. Hence, completion rates are generally not as high compared to in-person courses.

#### In-person
The main advantages of in-person courses are the interactions, which can help to solidify learning experiences and concepts. For UX Design specifically, students might benefit learning skills like drafting user-scenarios or prototyping with in-class guidance rather than through the web. As a result of in-person learning and collaboration, students would also be more motivated and completion rates for in-person courses are higher in general. However, such courses are limited by price and their locations. 

#### Recommendations
There are many bootcamps of both classifications for considerations. I have listed a few famous ones below for consideration that are more applicable for Singaporean students.

#### Potential pitfalls
Ineffective learning experiences: One mistake is to simply sign up for any program, thinking that all UX Design programs are the same. While most should impart some UX skillsets, the teaching methodology and therefore focus can be different. Consider analysing each course and asking a few questions:
* What kinds of portfolio deliverables will you produce through the program? Will you actually produce things you can showcase as evidence of your problem-solving skills?
* Does the program have a trusted network of potential employers that you can be connected with?
* How practical are the experiences that the program promises? How conceptual? How product-based? How process-based?

Be honest with your expectations on what you wish to get out of the course and find a suitable one base on your answers to the questions above.

## Engaging in individual UX projects
